# SaaS-NoHarass
An anti-harassment web service

As apart of the Major League Hacking [#hackharassment](https://hackharassment.com/mlh) challenge, this api was created by a group to help combat online harassment on the internet. 

# How it works:
The service uses an algorithm to filter through a text entry and returns a percentage for the likelihood that the message is harassment.
The text entries are compare to the words in text files inside the package. The text files are categorized separately to contain words that can be viewed as mild, medium, or harsh. These words can be altered at the discretion of the user to tailor the strictness of the filter to their needs.

# Who is it for:
The api can be used by any person hosting a website or some sort of web application that uses text entries.
